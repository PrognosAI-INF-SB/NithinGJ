# üß© Milestone 2 ‚Äî Model Development & Training  
### Project: **PrognosAI ‚Äî AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System**  
**Dataset:** NASA CMAPSS Multivariate Time-Series Sensor Data  

---

## üéØ Objective  
The goal of this milestone is to develop and train a deep learning model capable of predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of industrial machinery.  
Using sequential sensor data, the model learns degradation patterns over time to support **predictive maintenance** and minimize unplanned downtime.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Summary

### 1. Data Utilization  
- Used the preprocessed CMAPSS dataset from Milestone 1.  
- Split data into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets to ensure reliable evaluation.

### 2. Data Normalization  
- Scaled sensor values using normalization techniques to improve training stability and model performance.

### 3. Sequence Preparation  
- Created **time-windowed sequences** to capture historical trends in sensor data.  
- Each sequence represented a fixed-length history of engine operation cycles.

### 4. Model Development  
- Implemented a **deep learning model** (LSTM/GRU-based) designed to process sequential time-series data.  
- The model outputs a single **RUL value** representing the estimated remaining life of the equipment.

### 5. Training Strategy  
- Trained the model for multiple epochs with **early stopping** to prevent overfitting.  
- Used **model checkpointing** to save the best-performing version during training.  
- Monitored **training and validation loss** for convergence.

## üìä Results & Observations  

- **Loss Curves:**  
  Training and validation losses consistently decreased, confirming stable learning behavior.

- **Prediction Patterns:**  
  Predicted RUL values aligned well with actual RUL trends, showing the model effectively captured degradation patterns.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Achieved a **reasonable RMSE** on the validation set, suitable as a baseline for further optimization.

## üß† Insights  

- The model effectively learned **temporal dependencies** among multiple sensor readings.  
- Proper **regularization and early stopping** minimized overfitting risks.  
- Some deviations between actual and predicted RUL indicate opportunities for:  
  - Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., sequence length, learning rate).  
  - Feature refinement (selecting the most informative sensors).

## ‚úÖ Deliverables Completed  

- LSTM/GRU-based predictive model implemented.  
- Model trained and saved with optimal weights.  
- Visual results for training and validation loss generated.  
- Preliminary RUL predictions verified against validation data.

## üîú Next Steps (Milestone 3 ‚Äî Model Evaluation & Performance Assessment)  

- Evaluate the trained model on **unseen test data**.  
- Compute **RMSE** and **MAE** metrics for full performance analysis.  
- Plot **Predicted vs Actual RUL** graphs for deeper insight.  
- Investigate **model biases** and identify opportunities for improvement.
