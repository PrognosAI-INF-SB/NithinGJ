    "The purpose of Milestone 2 is to design and train a deep learning model capable of estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machinery based on time-series sensor data. "
    "This step focuses on transforming raw, preprocessed data from Milestone 1 into a predictive model that can understand complex temporal relationships between sensor readings and degradation behavior. "
    "By leveraging sequential learning techniques like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), the system aims to accurately recognize early failure patterns, enabling predictive maintenance decisions that minimize unexpected breakdowns, reduce costs, and enhance equipment reliability.",

# Process Summary

process_text = """
1. **Data Utilization** ‚Äì The preprocessed CMAPSS dataset from Milestone 1 was used. The data was split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.  

2. **Data Normalization** ‚Äì Sensor readings were scaled to a standard numerical range, which improves the model's convergence and helps it interpret varying sensor magnitudes consistently.  

3. **Sequence Preparation** ‚Äì Time-windowed sequences were created to help the model analyze how sensor behavior evolves over time. Each sequence represented a portion of an engine‚Äôs operational history.  

4. **Model Development** ‚Äì A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was developed. LSTM networks are ideal for time-series data because they can retain information about previous cycles, allowing the model to learn degradation trends effectively.  

5. **Training Strategy** ‚Äì The model was trained across multiple epochs using an adaptive learning rate and early stopping mechanisms. This ensured stable learning, reduced overfitting, and retained the best-performing version through model checkpointing.

# Results & Observations

results_text = """
- **Model Convergence:** The training and validation loss steadily decreased throughout training, showing that the model successfully captured useful temporal features from the sensor data.  

- **Prediction Behavior:** The predicted Remaining Useful Life values followed the actual RUL trends across multiple test engines. Although minor deviations were observed near end-of-life predictions, the overall accuracy and trend alignment were strong.  

- **Performance Analysis:** The model achieved a reasonable Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on the validation dataset. This indicates the model can generalize well to unseen machinery, providing a strong baseline for predictive maintenance applications.  

- **Training Stability:** Early stopping prevented overfitting by halting training once validation performance stabilized, ensuring that the final model remained both robust and efficient.
